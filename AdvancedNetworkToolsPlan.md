# Advanced Network Analysis Tools Integration Plan for WhiteDNS

## Objective
Integrate advanced network analysis tools into WhiteDNS that surpass capabilities of nmap and Burp Suite, including:
- Port scanning with advanced techniques and performance optimizations
- Vulnerability scanning with a comprehensive vulnerability database
- Web application testing for common and advanced web vulnerabilities
- Network traffic analysis for monitoring and anomaly detection

## Architecture
- Modular design with separate components for each toolset
- Shared core for network communication and reporting
- CLI interface with JSON output for automation and integration
- Extensible plugin system for adding new scanning modules

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Port Scanning
- Implement TCP SYN, TCP connect, UDP, and stealth scan techniques
- Support for scanning large IP ranges and ports with concurrency
- Service detection and banner grabbing
- Output results in JSON and human-readable formats

### Phase 2: Vulnerability Scanning
- Integrate vulnerability database (e.g., CVE, NVD feeds)
- Match detected services against known vulnerabilities
- Provide detailed vulnerability reports and remediation suggestions

### Phase 3: Web Application Testing
- Implement scanning for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Support for crawling, input fuzzing, and session management
- Integration with HTTP/HTTPS protocols and proxy support

### Phase 4: Traffic Analysis
- Capture and analyze network traffic for anomalies
- Detect suspicious patterns, DNS tunneling, and data exfiltration
- Provide real-time alerts and historical reports

## Dependencies and Libraries
- Use libpcap or equivalent for traffic capture
- Use existing vulnerability databases and parsers
- Use HTTP libraries for web testing (e.g., libcurl)
- Multithreading and async IO for performance

## Deliverables
- Updated WhiteDNS CLI with new commands and options
- JSON output for all new tools
- Documentation and usage examples
- Docker container updated with new dependencies

## Next Steps
- Confirm plan and priorities with user
- Begin Phase 1 implementation: advanced port scanning
